Hello there, I'm a student, a small web developer and a gamer and Ha Long, VietNam is where I live.

Welcome to my GitHub page, where I host my own website, my JavaScript project and more. I usually do all of the coding by my self because all of my friend can't really code.

> Shameless plug: If you want to check out more project and stuff that I do, visit: ~~https://quanmcpc.github.io~~ [https://quanmcpc.site](https://quanmcpc.site). I swear it's the best website in the world! (Note: The new domain is privately funded and not by me funded)

My average typing speed is around 84 WPS and the highest I was able to achived is 102 WPS as of August 7th 2021

Well, that's all I have to say. The chance of someone reading this is kinda low so I can't really put much effort into this. If you are reading this then: Good for you? I guess?

Thank you for visiting my GitHub page.
